## Website Enhancements

I added Javascript disclaimers to both the contact form and the project card load buttons with noscript tags. I made this change so that users are aware that Javascript is needed for the contact form's enhanced verification and to load the project cards. I added a background and border on the footer links in order to improve visibility (especially for mobile) when the website is on the dark theme. I moved all of my inline and other CSS from the HTML pages into stylesheets in order to make future styling of the pages easier. Additionally I refactored my theme switcher to use CSS variables for all of the styling changes in order to make creating themes and modifying them easier. I also moved all of my images to CloudFlare instead of using the GitHub repo in order to have faster distribution of images for users.
